# NLP-TensorFlow
Natural Language Processing project for language prediction using TensorFlow from dicoding Machine Learning Intermediate Class. 

## Dataset
- source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basilb2s/language-detection/data
- about: this dataset is filled with texts of 17 different languages

## Criteria
- dataset with 1000 minimum sample
- implement LSTM
- use model Sequential
- validation set is 20%
- implement Embedding
- implement Tokenizer
- minimmum accuracy from train and val set is 75% or &gt; 80%
- implement callbacks
- create plot loss and plot accuracy
