# NLP-TensorFlow
Natural Language Processing project for human stress prediction using TensorFlow from dicoding Machine Learning Intermediate Class. 

## Dataset
- source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kreeshrajani/human-stress-prediction
- about: this dataset is filled with users tweet in some subreddit's and then its labeled 0 if the user is not stressed and labeled 1 if the user is stressed

## Criteria
- dataset with 1000 minimum sample
- implement LSTM
- use model Sequential
- validation set is 20%
- implement Embedding
- implement Tokenizer
- minimmum accuracy from train and val set is 75% or &gt; 80%
- implement callbacks
- create plot loss and plot accuracy
